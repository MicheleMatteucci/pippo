pippo is the name of my repository (abilit√† informatiche).

'lecture_5.py' and 'lecture_6.py' are exercises done during actual class;

'lecture_7_homework.py' and 'lecture_8_homework.py' refer to assigned exercises because I did not attend last two classes in January.

File 'Dati.txt' is required to run 'lecture_7_homework.py';

Files 'dati.txt', 'Dati_8.txt' and 'mat.txt' are required to run 'lecture_8_homework.py'.
